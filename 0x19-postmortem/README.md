# Database Server Storage Outage Incident
## Issue Summary
- Duration: The outage occurred from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM (UTC) on March 25, 2024.

- Impact: The database server experienced complete downtime during the outage period, affecting all users accessing the platform. Approximately 85% of the users were unable to access critical data and services, resulting in a significant loss of functionality.

- Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as the database server running out of storage space due to unforeseen data growth and inadequate capacity planning.

## Timeline
- 3:00 PM (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating high disk usage on the database server.

- 3:10 PM (UTC): The engineering team was notified of the issue and initiated an investigation.

- 3:30 PM (UTC): Disk space was checked on the database server, revealing a critical storage shortage.

- 3:45 PM (UTC): The incident escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation.

- 4:30 PM (UTC): Disk space analysis conducted, identifying large data files consuming excessive storage.

- 4:45 PM (UTC): Temporary storage measures were implemented to free up disk space and restore service.

- 5:00 PM (UTC): Database server restarted to apply temporary storage adjustments.

- 5:30 PM (UTC): Database server restored to full functionality, confirmed by successful data retrieval and access.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- Root Cause: The database server ran out of storage space due to unforeseen data growth and inadequate capacity planning, leading to complete downtime.

- Resolution: Temporary storage measures were implemented to free up disk space, including archiving and compressing large data files. Additionally, a long-term solution involving storage expansion and capacity planning was proposed to prevent future occurrences.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

    - Implement automated monitoring for disk space utilization to detect potential storage shortages proactively.
    - Conduct regular capacity planning assessments to ensure sufficient storage resources for future growth.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
        
    - Archive and compress unused or redundant data files to free up immediate disk space.
    - Expand storage capacity on the database server to accommodate future data growth and prevent similar outages.
    - Establish storage management policies and procedures to maintain optimal disk usage and performance.

## Conclusion
The database server outage was caused by insufficient storage capacity, resulting in complete downtime and service disruption. Through prompt detection, investigation, and resolution, temporary measures were implemented to restore service and mitigate the immediate impact. Moving forward, long-term solutions will be implemented to prevent similar incidents and ensure the continued reliability and availability of critical data and services.
